        <h3>Special Containment Procedures:</h3>
        <p>Whereas the nature of SCP-006 does not warrant any extensive containment, a certain level of secrecy is necessary regarding the object's existence and properties, for obvious reasons.<mark> The following procedures are required not for personnel safety, but to deny or hide knowledge of SCP-006's effects from the personnel who interact with it.</mark></p>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>: <mark>All personnel interacting with SCP-006 in any physical way are required to wear modified Class VI BNC suits. Before personnel are allowed to perform procedures, they must be briefed with Material SCP-006B or SCP-006C. SCP-006A Briefing is the correct one and is restricted to only those with O5 clearance. </mark>To ensure personnel are wearing suits properly, they are to be submerged into a pool of water. Any air bubbles spotted signify a leak in the suit.</li>
                <li>: Procedures with SCP-006 are to be carried out under extreme surveillance. In case of contact with SCP-006, the commander in charge will announce Procedure 006-Xi-12, which the personnel have been briefed to believe to mean high toxicity is present and they must evacuate.</li>
                <li>: Any procedure in which <mark>liquid is acquired from SCP-006 must be approved by three (3) O5 level personnel. </mark>The liquid is to be <mark>transferred in a Quad-Sealant Container and under armed guard.</mark></li>
                <li>: If at any time personnel come into contact with SCP-006 or liquid from SCP-006, they are to be confined and terminated after sufficient studies are done. Due to the nature of SCP-006, the most effective termination method is incineration. (For full report, see file SCP006-TerO5)</li>
            </ol>

        <h3>Description:</h3>
        <p>SCP-006 is a very small spring located 60 km west of Astrakhan.<mark> Foundation Command was aware of its existence since the 19th century,</mark> but were unable to secure it until 1991 due to political reasons. On the spot of the spring, a chemical factory has been constructed as a disguise, with the majority of laborers under Foundation and/or Russian control.<mark> The liquid emitted from the spring has been chemically identified as simple mineral water in 1902, but has the unusual property of "health".</mark></p>
        <p>Ingesting the liquid produces the following properties in human beings:<mark> the ability to regenerate DNA damaged by sufficient duplication, heightened excitement of cellular duplication, vastly improved abilities in the repair of damaged tissue, and a frightening increase in the effectiveness of the human immune system. Upon testing the liquid on animal subjects, hostile bacteria and viral agents were destroyed immediately.</mark> Many reptiles and birds were unaffected, while higher primates experienced the same benefits as humans.</p>
